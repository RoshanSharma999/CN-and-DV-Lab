(1) Write a PySpark program to create a DataFrame with four columns: “name”, “age”, “city”, and
23“gender” and perform the following operations:
* Insert minimum 10 values for the given columns.
* Filter rows with age greater than 30.
* Add a new column named it “tax”.
* Rename the “age” column to “years”.
* Drop Multiple Columns from the given data frame.

(2) Write a PySpark program to create a DataFrame containing information about various products,
including ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, StockQuantity, & Rating and perform the
following operations:
* Insert minimum 10 values for the given columns.
* Sort the DataFrame first by Price in descending order and then by Category in ascending order.
* Find the total sales amount for each product by category.
* Find the total sales amount and the total quantity sold for each product.

(3) Using PySpark, analyze airline flight data (e.g., departure and arrival times, delays, carrier
information) and perform the following operations:
* Load a CSV file containing airline flight data
* Filter flights that were more than 15 minutes delayed.
* Analyze whether there is any correlation between the flight length and the likelihood of a delay.

(4) Consider airline flight data, given in the previous question. Perform the following operation
using PySpark
* Group the data by airline carrier and compute the average delay for each one.
* Determine the top five routes (origin-destination) with the highest average delay.

(5) Given Movie & Rating dataset containing user ratings for movies, using PySpark SQL perform the
following operations
* Load CSV files containing movie & rating data
* Create temporary views for movies and ratings.
* Write queries to find the top 10 highest-rated movies with at least 10 ratings.
* Find the most active users (users who have rated the most movies).

(6) Create a DataFrame containing real estate data with the following columns: HouseID, Location,
Size, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Price etc. Use the given dataset to build a linear regression model
using PySpark's MLlib to predict the Price of a house based on the other features.
* Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (Location),
and normalizing numerical features (Size, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, etc).
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train a linear regression model on the training data.
* Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using the root mean square error (RMSE)
* Display the feature importances and interpret the results.
